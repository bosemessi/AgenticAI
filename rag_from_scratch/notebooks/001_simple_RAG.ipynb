       "'On average, cats spend 2/3 of every day sleeping. That means a nine-year-old cat has been awake for only three years of its life.\\nUnlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.\\nWhen a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.\\nThe technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”\\nA group of cats is called a “clowder.”\\nFemale cats tend to be right pawed, while male cats are more often left pawed. Interestingly, while 90% of humans are right handed, the remaining 10% of lefties also tend to be male.\\nA cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down.\\nCats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10.\\nA cat’s brain is biologically more similar to a human brain than it is to a dog’s. Both humans and cats have identical regions in their brains that are responsible for emotions.\\nThere are more than 500 million domestic cats in the world, with approximately 40 recognized breeds.\\nWhile it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cats, the oldest known pet cat was recently found in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave predates early Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.\\nDuring the time of the Spanish Inquisition, Pope Innocent VIII condemned cats as evil and thousands of cats were burned. Unfortunately, the widespread killing of cats led to an explosion of the rat population, which exacerbated the effects of the Black Death.\\nDuring the Middle Ages, cats were associated with witchcraft, and on St. John’s Day, people all over Europe would stuff them into sacks and toss the cats into bonfires.

Newton was experimenting in a pitch-black room. Spithead, one of his cats, kept opening the door and wrecking his experiment. The cat flap kept both Newton and Spithead happy.\\nThe world’s rarest coffee, Kopi Luwak, comes from Indonesia where a wildcat known as the luwak lives.
